# Telecom-churn Prediction ML Models
## ANN,SVM,RF
Customer churn is a problem that all companies need to monitor, especially those that depend on subscription-based revenue streams. The simple fact is that most organizations have data that can be used to target these individuals and to understand the key drivers of churn. In this work I have used three methods for churn prediction. 
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
3. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
