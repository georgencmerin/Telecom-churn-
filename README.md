# Telecom-churn Prediction ML Models
## ANN,SVM,RF
Customer churn is a problem that all companies need to monitor, especially those that depend on subscription-based revenue streams. The simple fact is that most organizations have data that can be used to target these individuals and to understand the key drivers of churn.Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. One industry in which churn rates are particularly useful is the telecommunications industry, because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location..
In this work I have used three methods for churn prediction. 
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
3. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)

DataSet used: IBM Watson Telco Customer Churn Dataset  https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

ANN: 
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are now a staple within the sub-field of Machine Learning.
2. Deep learning algorithms can be vastly superior to traditional regression and classification methods.
3. The ability to model interactions between features that would otherwise go undetected
4. The challenge becomes explainability, which is often needed to support the business case. The good news is we get the best of both worlds with keras and lime.

RF:
1. Random Forest is often known as an ensemble of a large number of Decision Trees.
2. As bootstrapped aggregation technique to choose random samples from a dataset to train each tree in the forest. The final prediction in a Random Forest is an aggregation of prediction of individual trees.
3. One of the advantages of Random Forest is that, it gives out-of-bag(OOB) error estimates, which is the mean prediction error on a training sample, using the trees that do not have that training sample in their bootstrap sample.

SVM:
1. The advent of computers brought on rapid advances in the field of statistical classification, one of which is the Support Vector Machine, or SVM. 
2. The goal of an SVM is to take groups of observations and construct boundaries to predict which group future observations belong to based on their measurements.
3. SVMs can take almost any shape (including linear, radial, and polynomial, among others), and are generally flexible enough to be used in almost any classification endeavor that the user chooses to undertake.

from the work we found improvements to reduce churn 

1. Use incentives to create non-cash mobile rewards programs
2. Constantly answer customer feedback on all channels. Especially social media.
3. Anticipate churn by investing in better technology.
4. Resolving Customer Service Issues.
5. Managing Customer Lifetime Value.
6. Big Data Analytics Platforms for Reducing Churn.
